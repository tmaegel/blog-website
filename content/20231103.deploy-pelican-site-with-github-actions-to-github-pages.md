This blog is powered by [Pelian](https://getpelican.com/). It is a static site generator that requires no database or server-side logic and generates your website based on the content which is written in `reStructuredText` or `Markdown`.

I host this site with GitHub Pages. So I though its the best choice to automatically deploy my changes (e.g. content or theme/template) and update my site as well on GitHub Pages by using GitHub Actions.

My deployment workflow based on the following GitHub Actions:

- [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
- [actions/setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python)
- [JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action)

In the first step I checkout my GitHub repository with `actions/checkout` which holds my content and theme data of this site. Afterwards I prepare the python environment to install the needed python dependencies (e.g. `pelican`) to build my site based on the content and the templates. Finally I use the Github action `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action` to deploy the build results to GitHub Pages. This Actions takes the build results of `pelican`. In my case from the directory `build` and commit/push these to the corresponding branch (e.g. `gh-pages`).

This results in the following GitHub Actions workflow.

```yaml
name: Deployment

env:
  PELICAN_CONTENT_DIR: content
  PELICAN_BUILD_DIR: build
  PELICAN_CONFIG_FILE: pelicanconf.py

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  build:
    concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Build with pelican
        run: pelican $PELICAN_CONTENT_DIR -o $PELICAN_BUILD_DIR -s $PELICAN_CONFIG_FILE

      - name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          folder: ${{ env.PELICAN_BUILD_DIR }}
          branch: gh-pages
```
